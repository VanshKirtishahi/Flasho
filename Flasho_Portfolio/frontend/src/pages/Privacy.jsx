This Privacy Policy is designed to provide full transparency regarding our data governance practices. It meticulously details how we collect, utilize, store, process, and protect your information when you interact with our Platform.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. CORPORATE NATURE AND SCOPE</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Flasho operates exclusively as a highly integrated technology platform and digital intermediary. Our primary function is to seamlessly connect prospective customers with rigorously verified independent service agencies specializing in home, office, maintenance, repair, and various other professional services. It is important to clarify that Flasho acts solely as a service marketplace and technological facilitator. We do not directly employ, manage, or supervise the service personnel deployed by these independent agencies unless expressly stated otherwise in specific contractual agreements.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">To provide a highly tailored and efficient service experience, we systematically collect various categories of information. Firstly, we gather Personal Information, which includes your full legal name, active mobile telephone number, primary email address, optional profile photographs, and exact residential or service delivery addresses. Secondly, we collect Account Information necessary for platform access, which encompasses your secure login credentials, customizable user preferences, saved multiple addresses for recurring services, and a comprehensive log of your booking history.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Furthermore, we process Transaction Information, detailing the specifics of your bookings, chronological service history, secure payment routing data, formal invoice records, and any documentation related to refunds or dispute resolutions. We also automatically capture Device Information to optimize platform performance. This includes logging your IP address, browser type and version, specific device models, operating system architecture, and unique device identifiers. Finally, subject to your explicit consent, Flasho may collect precise Location Information utilizing GPS and cellular network telemetry to accurately identify operable service areas, significantly improve our algorithmic service matching, and provide localized offerings tailored to your immediate geographic vicinity.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. METHODOLOGIES OF DATA COLLECTION</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Our data collection protocols are multifaceted to ensure platform efficacy. We collect information directly from you during your active engagements with the Platform, such as when you initially register for a user account, initiate a service booking, contact our dedicated support teams, submit digital forms, or opt-in to our promotional updates. Additionally, we employ automated data collection mechanisms that continuously operate in the background while you navigate the Platform. These automated tools utilize tracking cookies, advanced analytics software, server-side website logs, and mobile application telemetry data to understand user behavior. We also receive supplementary information from trusted Third Parties, strictly limiting this to verified payment gateway processors, officially onboarded partner agencies, independent identity verification providers, and integrated customer support management systems.</p>

          <hr className="my-8 border-gray-200" />

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. UTILIZATION OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">The information we collect is strictly utilized for predetermined, legitimate business purposes. Primarily, your data is essential for Service Delivery, allowing us to accurately process service bookings, optimally assign the most suitable service providers, and efficiently manage ongoing customer requests. We also leverage this information for Customer Support operations, utilizing your historical data to rapidly resolve ongoing issues, respond to complex inquiries, and systematically improve our overall service quality based on user feedback.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Platform Operations heavily rely on your data to maintain stringent cybersecurity protocols, detect and prevent fraudulent activities, and dynamically monitor platform performance metrics. We utilize your contact details for Communication purposes, sending critical booking confirmations, real-time service arrival updates, transactional alerts, and important platform-wide administrative announcements. Lastly, we process your information to ensure strict Legal Compliance, fulfilling our statutory tax reporting requirements, responding to lawful government subpoenas, and adhering to all overarching legal obligations mandated by the governing jurisdictions.</p>

          <hr className="my-8 border-gray-200" />

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Flasho maintains a strict corporate policy against the monetization or sale of your personal information to unverified third parties. We strictly limit the sharing of your data to entities directly involved in the service fulfillment lifecycle. We share absolutely necessary information with our Partner Agencies, restricting the disclosed data to your name, contact number, exact service address, and specific booking requirements to ensure the successful execution of the requested task.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">We transmit encrypted financial data to our approved Payment Service Providers solely to securely authorize and process your financial transactions. Furthermore, we collaborate with specialized Technology Service Providers who assist us with secure cloud hosting, user analytics, customer support ticketing, and advanced cybersecurity monitoring. In highly specific scenarios, we may be compelled to disclose your information to recognized Government Authorities or law enforcement agencies, but only when strictly required by enforceable legal statutes, court orders, or formal regulatory mandates.</p>
